#### What is Jquery
> jQuery is a lightweight, "write less, do more", JavaScript library. The purpose of jQuery is to make it much easier to use JavaScript on your website.
jQuery takes a lot of common tasks that require many lines of JavaScript code to accomplish, and wraps them into methods that you can call with a single line of code. jQuery also simplifies a lot of the complicated things from JavaScript, like AJAX calls and DOM manipulation. The jQuery library contains the following features:
> - HTML/DOM manipulation
> - CSS manipulation
> - HTML event methods
> - Effects and animations
> - AJAX
>- Utilities

#### jQuery Syntax
> The jQuery syntax is tailor-made for selecting HTML elements and performing some action on the element(s).
*Basic syntax is:* **$(selector).action()**
> 1.A $ sign to define/access jQuery
> 2.A (selector) to "query (or find)" HTML elements
> 3.A jQuery action() to be performed on the element(s)
----
#### Add a jquery script in the HTML file.
>An event represents the precise moment when something happens.
*Examples:*
> - moving a mouse over an element
> - selecting a radio button
> - clicking on an element
> - The term "fires/fired" is often used with events. 
**Example: "The keypress event is fired, the moment you press a key".**
* Using 'click' Events on each 'div' element to show/hide(toggle) the content on click. 
* Using 'movesover' and 'mouseleave' Events on the classes 'first' and 'second' and use hide() function.
* Using 'focus' and 'blur' Events in a form while entering the data. Using CSS background color inside the Script syntax.
