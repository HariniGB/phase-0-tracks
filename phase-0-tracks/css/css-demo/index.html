    <b>1.What does the "Cascading" part of Cascading Style Sheets mean? When there is a conflict between two CSS rules that select the same element, how does your browser decide which rule to use? </b> <br>
    <strong>Answer: </strong>"Cascading" means that styles can fall (or cascade) from one style sheet to another, enabling multiple style sheets to be used on one HTML document.<br>
        <div style="border: thick; background-color: #bfbfbf">
        <em><b>For instance:</b></em>
        We are using three CSS files elegant-styles.css, fixed-contact.css and practice.css for one HTML file index.html (this file). 
        </div><br>
    <strong>Answer: </strong>The browser decides which rule to use based on the CSS Specificity. If two selectors apply to the same element, the one with higher specificity wins. Every selector has its place in the specificity hierarchy. There are four distinct categories which define the specificity level of a given selector: <br>
     <ol type="1">
          <li>Inline styles (Presence of style in document):  An inline style lives within your XHTML document. It is attached directly to the element to be styled. E.g. &lt;h1 style=&quot;color: #fff;&quot; &gt;</li>
          <li> IDs (# of ID selectors): ID is an identifier for your page elements, such as #div</li>
          <li>Classes, attributes and pseudo-classes (# of class selectors).
          This group includes .classes, [attributes] and pseudo-classes such as :hover, :focus etc.</li> 
          <li> Elements and pseudo-elements (# of Element (type) selectors).
          Including for instance :before and :after.</li>
    </ol><br>
        <div style="border: thick; background-color: #bfbfbf">
        <em><b>For instance:</b></em>
        In this HTML file, we have used &lt;section&gt; with id=&quot;contact-info &quot; and have given padding in two different css selectors. The first padding (padding : 30px )is done with the ID selector but the second padding (which is right and left padding each value 20px) property is done with inline display of the content. So the browser takes the right and left padding with value 20px. And the top and the bottom padding with value 30px. <mark> refer practice.css </mark>

         <b>Find a cheat sheet or quick guide on CSS selectors, or refer to a cheat sheet you've already bookmarked. What is a pseudoselector? Write a CSS rule that uses a pseudoselector.</b><br>
         <strong>Answers:</strong><br>
          Select the link to see the cheat sheet: 
            <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/images/css3-cheat-sheet/preview.gif"> <b>CSS cheat sheet </b></a><br>
         <span style="color: blue">Pseudo class selector:</span> A pseudo-class is used to define a special state of an element. They are used to style an element when a user mouses over it, style visited and unvisited links differently, style an element when it gets focus, etc. There are various pseudo selectors like :hover,:link,:visited,:active. The  :: first-letter, ::after, ::before and ::selection are known as pseudo-elements. 
                <div style="border: thick; background-color: #bfbfbf">
                <em><b>For instance:</b></em>
                 See the practice.css file for &lt;a&gt;. Try to use the below link to test. <br>
                <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/Css/tryit.asp?filename=trycss_link"> <b>Test link </b></a>. 
                <br> The link text must be red in color and turns pink when your place your mouse over it and must turn to blue color while clicking and finally green color once it is clicked.

        <b>3. How can you use CSS to select the child element of another element (for instance, a section inside another section, or an li inside a ul but not inside an ol)? Add an example of such a rule in your CSS.</b><br>
         <strong>Answers:</strong> There is a CSS selector, really a pseudo-selector, called nth-child. Child selectors provide a way to select elements that fall within one another, thus making them children of their parent element. These selections can be made two different ways, using either descendant or direct child selectors.<br>
         <em><b>Decendent selector:</b></em> Selects an element that resides anywhere within an identified ancestor element.
         <div style=" background-color: #bfbfbf">
                <em><b>For instance:</b></em>See the practice.css file. The code article with header h2 is used to specify the h2 (child)content inside the article (parent).
                <article id="child-example">
                <h2>The font size will be big for this &lt;h2&gt;</h2>
                <div>
                <h2>The background color is pink for this &lt;h2&gt; </h2>
                </div>
                </article><br>
                </div>
        <em><b>Direct child selector:</b></em>Selects an element that resides immediately inside an identified parent element.
        <div style=" background-color: #bfbfbf">
                <em><b>For instance:</b></em>See the practice.css file. The code where I have used parent ul and child li with the nth child selector.
                <ol>
                <li>First child </li>
                 <li>Second child </li>
                  <li>Third child </li>
                   <li>Fourth child</li>
                    <li>Fifth child</li>
                </ol><br>
