    -Else, iterate to the next floor_button in the menu bar and continue the check until the floor_button_label is equal to floor_number value.
For each floor:
    -Increment the current_floor_number if the floor_number is greater than current_floor_number.
    -Else decrement the current_floor_number if the floor_number is less than the current_floor_number.
If current_floor_number is equal to the floor_number, then
    -Check whether the elevator door is open:
       -If the door is open, then enter the lift.
       -else if the door is closed, then wait for until the door is open.
