     <h2>About Me </h2>
     <p>Hello! My name is Harini, an aspiring software engineer. I was born in Bangalore,India and moved to California last year.

     My background is in Information technology and Engineering. I obtained a Bachelor of Technology major in Information Technology in the prestigious Anna University,India. I started my career in 2014 as a AX Functional consultant in Microsoft Dynamics in India.Currently, I am learning the technologies involved inweb development with an intention to proceed my career as a web developer.

     One thing I really like about programming is being able to play around with my code and the ability to instantly see the changes that I apply.

    <h2>Passion</h2>
    <em>Painting and Designing</em>
    <p>Painting is an art of playing with colors and textures. Since my childhood I have a great passion in painting which lead me to learn various types of painting like warli painting, tanjore painting, glass painting and metal embossing. After moving to California, I started to decorate my interior house with eco-friendly paintings made by me. During this process, I was fascinated by the eco-friendly project ideas and their usage.

    <h2>Hobby</h2>
    <em>Cooking and Baking is fun!</em>
    <p>Baking is a wonderful way to spark a lifelong love of the kitchen in your children. I love to make muffins and cookies. In my life baking and cooking is like therapy that gives me relaxation and happiness. It's messy (and therefore fun!) and the results are hard to resist.
