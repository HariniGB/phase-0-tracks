<p> A season is a division of the year marked by changes in weather, ecology and hours of daylight. Seasons result from the yearly orbit of the Earth around the Sun and the tilt of the Earth's rotational axis relative to the plane of the orbit. In temperate and polar regions, the seasons are marked by changes in the intensity of sunlight that reaches the Earth's surface, variations of which may cause animals to go into hibernation or to migrate, and plants to be <em>dormant.</em></p>

	<h3 id="fall" style="text-align: center; color: #263238">Fall</h3>
    <p> The season of the year between summer and winter, during which the weather becomes cooler and many plants become dormant, extending in the <b>Northern Hemisphere </b>from the autumnal equinox to the winter solstice and popularly considered to include the months of September, October, and November; fall. In the Southern Hemisphere autumn includes March, April, and May.</p>

    	<h4> Travel to SF</h4>
    	<p> The best time to visit <b>San Francisco</b> is from September to November. Believe it or not, fall offers some of the city's warmest temperatures year round, not to mention fewer crowds than summer. Spring is another good time, to visit as well with its mild temperatures and lack of rain <i>(compared to other parts of California)</i>. The Golden Gate City witnesses a surge in tourism during the summer as people head west in search of sun, sand and surf. However, the fluctuating climate can quickly trounce a day at the beach. Those looking for the perfect seaside getaway should consider a trip to <b>Los Angeles </b>where the sunshine lasts year-round. Meanwhile, winter in San Francisco draws bargain-hunters with the promise of lower hotel rates and fewer people. If you decide to travel in the wintertime, arm yourself from the chilly temperatures with plenty of layers.</p>

	<h3 id="winter" style="text-align: center; color: #263238"> Winter</h3>
    <p>Winter is the coldest season of the year in polar and temperate climates, between autumn and spring. Winter is caused by the axis of the Earth in that hemisphere being oriented away from the Sun. Different cultures define different dates as the start of winter, and some use a definition based on weather. When it is winter in the <b>Northern Hemisphere</b>, it is summer in the Southern Hemisphere, and vice versa. In many regions, winter is associated with snow and freezing temperatures. The moment of winter solstice is when the sun's elevation with respect to the North or South Pole is at its most negative value <em>(that is, the sun is at its farthest below the horizon as measured from the pole)</em>, meaning this day will have the shortest day and the longest night. The earliest sunset and latest sunrise dates outside the polar regions differ from the date of the winter solstice, however, and these depend on latitude, due to the variation in the solar day throughout the year caused by the Earth's elliptical orbit.</p>

	<h3 id="spring" style="text-align: center; color: #263238"> Spring</h3>
    <p>Spring is one of the four conventional temperate seasons, following winter and preceding summer. There are various technical definitions of spring, but local usage of the term varies according to local climate, cultures and customs. When it is spring in the Northern Hemisphere, it will be autumn in the Southern Hemisphere and vice versa. At the spring equinox, days are approximately <b>12 hours long</b> with day length increasing as the season progresses.<br>
    Spring and "springtime" refer to the season, and also to ideas of rebirth, rejuvenation, renewal, resurrection and regrowth. Subtropical and tropical areas have climates better described in terms of other seasons, e.g. dry or wet, monsoonal or cyclonic. Often, cultures have locally defined names for seasons which have little equivalence to the terms originating in Europe.</p>

	<h3> Summer</h3>
    <p>Summer is the hottest of the four temperate seasons, falling between spring and autumn. At the summer solstice, the days are longest and the nights are shortest, with day-length decreasing as the season progresses after the solstice. The date of the beginning of summer varies according to climate, tradition and culture. When it is summer in the Northern Hemisphere, it is winter in the Southern Hemisphere, and vice versa.</p>

 <h3> Reflect Answers</h3>
 <p style="background-color: #ffffff">
<b>1.)What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?</b>
HTL Semantics helps the browser and the developer to differentiate the content based upon their semantic meaning. For example: article helps the browser to understand that the content is independent and it allows h1-h6 and other elements inside an article but it displays it as in like a news article with smaller header size when compared to normal h1-h6 outside an article.<br>

There are many semantics like &lt;article&gt;, &lt;article&gt;,&lt;aside&gt;,&lt;details&gt;,&lt;figcaption&gt;,&lt;figure&gt;,&lt;footer&gt;,&lt;header&gt;,&lt;main&gt;,&lt;mark&gt;,&lt;nav&gt;,&lt;section&gt;,&lt;summary&gt;,&lt;time&gt;,etc. I feel that article, footer and section are used commonly. Figure and figcaption is used when we work with images and videos. But most of the time HTML uses article, section to segregate the contents in a layout form. Footer is used to display the link to home page, copy rights and date the content updated etc.  

<br><br><b>2.) What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?</b>
HTML pages are interpreted entirety from top to bottom. The first elements will load first, the last one at the last.

For instance, if you place a CSS script at the top of the body then it will be executed prior to any elements within the body loading; whereas if you place the CSS script at the end of the body, all elements within the body will load then the script will be executed.

<br><br><b>3.)What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?</b>
I learned how to create a snippet in a sublime file and analysed where the file is stored when I save it in my system. I am not aware of the complete features of snippet and its usage. I guess I might create and use it more in future.

<br><br><b>4.)What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?</b>
Creating snippet was challenging because it is a new concept. Learning a new concept with a pair was different. Not difficult, but it leads to few confusions. However, it helps to correct if anyone of them has wrongly understood the concept. But other than that HTML tasks were not too hard after one week of training. <br>
