# Virus Predictor

# I worked on this challenge [by myself, with: ].
# We spent [#] hours on this challenge.

# EXPLANATION OF require_relative
# It brings different programs using 'require'. Especially ruby models from gem.
# require_relative complements the builtin method require by allowing you to load a file that is relative to the file containing the require_relative statement.
# When you use require to load a file, you are usually accessing functionality that has been properly installed, and made accessible, in your system. require does not offer a good solution for loading files within the projectâ€™s code. 

require_relative 'state_data'

class VirusPredictor
  
  # initialize method with 3 parameters and assign them as instance variables. 
  def initialize(state_of_origin, population_density, population)
    @state = state_of_origin
    @population = population
    @population_density = population_density
  end

  # a method that calls two other instnace methods.
  def virus_effects
    predicted_deaths
    speed_of_spread
  end

  private # all methods that follow will be made private: not accessible for outside objects.
  # Private methods cannot be called with an explicit receiver - the receiver is always self. This means that private methods can be called only in the context of the current object; you cannot invoke another object's private methods.
  

  # Refractor: Refactor the private methods predicted_deaths and speed_of_spread. Avoid DRY.
